    <p class = "youtiful">Sa lahat ng mga songs ng skz, ito yung pinaka favorite ko and it’s one of my comfort songs which makes me happy every time I listen to it:). This song kasi is like an inspirational message from stray kids which means to tell someone that they are enough, more than beautiful of one of a kind, and reminding them that “I’m always by your side”. It actually has a lot of meaning and for sure maintindihan mo pa siya lalo if you try to listen to it. This song reminds me of you, because every time you took a glance, I always see the universe in your eyes. ANG PRETTYYYY ng eyes mo no joke, di kita binobola or something kasi totoo naman talaga siya. Di lang sya pretty, but may sarili ring emotions and liwanag hehe. I like to take a glance to your eyes talaga before pa pero ngayon, I’m so scared to take a look na kasi baka magka eye contact tayo… mahiyain pa naman ako 😭. PARANG NAKIKITA KO TALAGA YUNG UNIVERSE SA MATA MO GAYA NG SABI SA KANTAAA. AND ANG POGIII MO RIN, masyado ka atang humble kaya lagi mo sinasabi na ang galing ko mangbola, but no totoo sinasabi ko and I know marami rin umaagree dito 😼. Ang ganda rin talaga ng meaning ng song na ito, gusto ko rin ksi sabihin na “You’re amazing as you are.”, and don’t you ever tell yourself you’re not enough kahit sa ano mang bagay pa iyan, kasi I know each of us always try our best so don’t ever doubt yourself ano man pinagdadaanan mo sa buhay :))). I also want to stay by your side until we can be closer na sa g10 and these upcoming years. Yung title na “Youtiful” is actually a combined word of “You’re beautiful” which means “You are beautiful as who you are.” It means, in my eyes you’re perfect as you are, all of us has flaws and nagkakaroon din tayo ng mistakes, it’s okay though since we always have a chance na magbago and mag-improve. I like to always compliment you na ang ganda ng eyes mo ganon, ang pogi mo, ang talino mo, ang galing mo magpublic speaking, but di lang naman sa mga aspect na ito kita nagustuhan. It’s because of who you are, and for me you are YOUTIFUL <333.</p>
